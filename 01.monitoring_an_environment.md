# Monitoring an Environment

**Regular `nmap` diffing:**

A script that is created to email us daily diffs of the `nmap` results. [nmap_diffing.sh](Tools/nmap_diffing.sh).

**Web Screenshot:**

Monitors for different web applications.
Tools to use: 
- HTTPScreenshot - Uses `masscan` to scan network and `phantomjs` to take screencaptures of any website found.
- EyeWitness - takes an `xml` file from `nmap` output and screenshots webpages, RDP servers, and VNC Servers.

**Cloud Scanning:**

Many users of the cloud have dynamic IPs, so it's hard to have a specific IP address, as it depends on many factors, which for an outsider makes it hard to find them.

**Shodan:**

It regularly scans the internet, grabs banners, ports, information about network, and more. 

**Censys.io:**

Continuously monitors every reachable server and device on the internet. It also scrapes information from SSL certificates, so this can be used to find where the victim's servers are located on cloud servers.

A script tool to query Censys: [https://github.com/christophetd/censys-subdomain-finder](Censys Subdomain Finder).

**Manually Parsing SSL Certificates**

Many companies don't have ACLs properly implemented, but many databases, Jenkin servers, Tomcat management, etc are publicly facing.

A tool to use is `sslScrape` which uses `Masscan`, identifies services on port 443, and then strips the hostname in the certificates. [https://github.com/cheetz/sslScrape](sslScrape).

**Discover Scripts:**

This tool combines all the recon tools on Kali Linux and utilizes the following tools: `dnsrecon`, `goofile`, `goog-mail`, `goohost`, `theHarvester`, `Metasploit`, `URLCrazy`, `Whois`, `recon-ng`, etc.

A good part of this tool is that it keeps searching based on the information it finds.

**KNOCK** - Subdomain brute-force
