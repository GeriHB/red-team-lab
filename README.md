# Red Team Lab

This is a VM-only penetration-testing lab created to practice the exercises and techniques from **The Hacker Playbook 3**.  
It is an isolated, local environment used solely for learning and experimentation with recon, exploitation, and post-exploit workflows.

**Based on:** *The Hacker Playbook 3* (Practical offensive-security exercises and playbooks).  
**Goal:** safely reproduce and practice the bookâ€™s labs and techniques on VMs you control, so different tooling, methodologies, and safe operational habits can be trained without impacting external systems.
